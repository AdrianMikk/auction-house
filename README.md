# Semester Project 2 - Echobids Auction House

# Description

# Goal

The goal of this project is to apply the skills acquired over the past three semesters to develop a fully functional auction website. The website allows users to list items for auction, place bids on items, and engage in a dynamic marketplace.

# Brief

The auction website aims to create a user-friendly platform where registered users can list items for auction, place bids on other users' items, and participate in an interactive bidding process. Upon joining the website, users are provided with 1000 credits to initiate their auction activities. Users can earn credits by selling items and utilize credits to purchase items listed by others. Non-registered users have the ability to browse through the available listings, but only registered users can actively participate in the auction process.

# Requirements

This project exclusively focuses on developing the frontend application for an existing backend API. The key functionalities include:

## User Authentication:

- Users with a stud.noroff.no email address can register.
- Registered users can log in and log out.
- User Profile Management:

- Registered users can update their avatar.
- Registered users can view their total credits.
- Listing Management:
- Registered users can create a listing with essential details such as title, deadline date, media gallery, and a description.

### Bidding:
